# Implementation Progress

## Setup Phase
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank structure
- [x] Create project documentation files
- [x] Complete file verification
  - [x] Check essential files existence
  - [x] Verify directory structure
  - [x] Document key components
- [x] Determine task complexity
  - [x] Analyzed potential task types
  - [x] Categorized by complexity level
  - [x] Documented in activeContext.md
- [x] Summarize findings and next steps

## Exploration Phase
- [x] Understand project structure
- [x] Review existing code
  - [x] Elastic scaling models
  - [x] Elastic scaling services
  - [x] Elastic scaling DTOs
  - [x] Elastic scaling handlers
- [x] Identify key components
- [ ] Document dependencies

## Analysis Phase
- [ ] Document elastic scaling workflow in detail
- [ ] Create sequence diagram for scaling process
- [ ] Identify potential improvement areas
- [ ] Review error handling in elastic scaling service

## Implementation Phase
- [ ] Not started yet

## Testing Phase
- [ ] Not started yet

## Deployment Phase
- [ ] Not started yet

## Completed Tasks
- Created Memory Bank directory structure
- Created initial documentation:
  - Project Brief
  - Technical Context
  - Product Context
  - System Patterns
  - Active Context
- Explored elastic scaling functionality:
  - Analyzed data models
  - Analyzed service implementation
  - Analyzed DTOs
  - Analyzed API handlers
- Completed complexity assessment for elastic scaling tasks
- Summarized findings and documented next steps

## In Progress Tasks
None currently - VAN mode initialization complete

## Blocked Tasks
None currently

## Next Steps
- For Level 1 tasks: Proceed directly to implementation
- For Level 2-4 tasks: Switch to PLAN mode for proper planning
- For further exploration:
  - Document the elastic scaling workflow in detail
  - Create sequence diagrams for key processes
  - Identify potential improvement areas
  - Review error handling in the elastic scaling service

## Notes
- Initial setup of Memory Bank completed
- VAN mode initialization process completed successfully
- Focusing on understanding the elastic scaling functionality
- Determined that most elastic scaling enhancements would fall into Level 2 or Level 3 complexity

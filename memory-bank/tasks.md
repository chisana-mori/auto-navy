## Notes
- This file serves as the single source of truth for all task tracking
- Tasks should be updated regularly to reflect current status
- Each task should be broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks
- Most elastic scaling enhancements would fall into Level 2 or Level 3 complexity
- VAN mode initialization is now complete
- For Level 1 tasks: Proceed directly to implementation
- For Level 2-4 tasks: Switch to PLAN mode for proper planning
